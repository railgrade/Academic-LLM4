## Datasets

* Sandia matrices: a set of rules
* Synthetic RPMs: first-order logic
* D-Set and G-Set
* PGM: relation, object, attribute
* RAVEN: hierarchical structure (relation, attributes):

  > entity: type/shape, size, color
  > layout: number, position
  > component structure: L-R, U-D, O-IC, O-IG
  > relations: Constant, Progression, Arithmetic, Distribute Three
